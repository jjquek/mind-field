// routes are not generated by default for collection entries; we need to generate them dynamically. see: https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#generating-routes-from-content
import { getCollection } from "astro:content";
// 1. Generate a new path for every collection entry
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const blogEntries = await getCollection("blog");
  return blogEntries.map((entry) => ({
    params: { slug: entry.slug },
    props: { entry },
  }));
}
// This will generate a new page for every entry in the blog collection. For example, an entry at src/content/blog/hello-world.md will have a slug of hello-world, and therefore its final URL will be /posts/hello-world/.
// 2. When it's time to render, you can get the entry directly from the prop
const { entry } = Astro.props;
const { Content } = await entry.render();
